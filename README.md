Installation:

```
sudo apt install golang-go
go get -u github.com/markus-wa/demoinfocs-golang
```

Running:


You will need a demo file. You can find some demo files at [hltv.org](https://www.hltv.org/) like [this one](https://www.hltv.org/download/demo/20663)

The demo file should be in `/demos`

```
go run main.go
```

For now, the demo name should be `mibr.dem`. It will be changed soon.
